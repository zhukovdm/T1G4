Our domain focuses on a regional public transport. The document preserves
the data model structure drawn as UML diagram and extends it with sufficient
descriptions of classes and properties used within the diagram.

Transit route (Linka)

    description:

        Transit route is a ground path from one point to another with
        unique identification within and city and predefined stations to visit.

    attributes:

      * number is a route unique identification,
      * length is measured in km,
      * valid from is a date when agency starts to operate the route,
      * valid to is the last date when route becomes publicly unavailable.

    relations:

        Transit route contains connections.
        Transit route starts with station.
        Transit route ends with station.

Connection (Spoj)

    description:

        Connection is a particular instance of a transit route which has its id.
        Each connection goes through the set of stops.

    attributes:

      * number is a unique identification of a particular connection.

    relations:

        Connection always belongs to some transit route.

Stop (Zastavení)

    description:

        Stop is a coincidence of id (point in the universe), arrival time
        and departure time. Set of stops define a connection.

    attributes:

      * id is self-describing,
      * arrival time is self-describing,
      * departure time is self-describing.

    relations:

        Stop is followed by another stop.
        Stop is preceded by another stop.
        Connection connects at least two stops.
        Stop always serves a real (physical) station.

Station (Stanice)

    description:

        Station is a physical point on a map. Any stop must be covered by
        some station.

    attributes:

      * gps is a certain position on a ground, where station is located,

      * capacity is an amount of people, that could fit into a station
        simultaneously.

    relations:

        Station is served by a set of stops.
        Station could be a termination point (either start or end) for a transit route.

Train station (Vlaková stanice)

    description:

        Train station is a subclass of the Station without special properties.

Bus station (Autobusová stanice)

    description:

        Bus station is a subclass of the Station without special properties.
