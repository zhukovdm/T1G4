Our domain focuses on a regional public transport, which is served by **trains**
and **buses** exclusively. These **vehicles** share traits such as *capacity*,
*fuel consumption*, *length*, *purchasing price* and **producer**. While
**buses** use identified by *license plate number*, **trains** are identified
by *EVN*, which also can be used to determine dependent/independent
*traction*.

Each **vehicle** is owned by **transit agency**, which has its individual
*name* and various amount of contact possibilities, like *phone* and *email*.

**Vehicles** then execute **connections**, by each **connection** being done
by exactly one **vehicle**. Multiple **connections** are grouped into a
**transit route** with its *license number*, given *length*, and *validity
from - to*, which specifies for how long can public transport be provided on
this route. Each individual **connection** has also its *number* within that
**route** and also *depature* and *arrival* time.

Each **connection** consists of multiple **stops** (as events), having
*arrival* and *departure* time, while happening at a given **station** .
**Stations** can be split into two kinds: **train stations** and **bus
stations**, which are very different in reality, but have common traits for
the sake of public transport: *geolocation*, *name* and (vehicular)
*capacity*.
