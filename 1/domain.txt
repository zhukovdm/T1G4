Our domain focuses on a regional public transport. The document preserves
the data model structure drawn as UML diagram and extends it with sufficient
descriptions of classes and properties used within the diagram.

Transit route (Linka)

    description:

        Transit route is a ground path from one point to another with

      * valid from is a date when agency starts to operate the route,
      * valid to is the last date when route becomes publicly unavailable.

    relations:

        Transit route contains connections.
        Transit route starts with station.
        Transit route ends with station.

Connection (Spoj)

    description:

        Connection is a particular instance of a transit route which has its id.
        Each connection goes through the set of stops.

    relations:

        Each connection belongs to some transit route.

Stop (Zastavení)

    description:

        Stop is a coincidence of id (point in the universe), arrival time
        and departure time. Set of stops define a connection.

    attributes:

      * gps is a certain point on a map,
      * arrival time is a self-describing attribute,
      * departure time is a self-describing attribute.

    relations:

        Stop is followed by another stop.
        Stop is preceded by another stop.
        Connection connects at least two stops.
        Each stop is served by some station.

Station (Stanice)

    description:

        Station could be a termination point (either start or end) for a transit route.

Train station (Vlaková stanice)

    description:

        Train station is a subclass of the Station without special properties.

Bus station (Autobusová stanice)

    description:

        Bus station is a subclass of the Station without special properties.
